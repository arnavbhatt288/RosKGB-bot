IDI NAHUI!
Cyka Blyad...
Vadim Blyat!
iiis Boris!
Working with computers has always been almost like a ritual too me. Things have to be done just right in correct place, perfectly configured and of course Vodka cooled.
I worked at software company in this big cyka of a building. The name of company was high on top of the building. But somehow interestingly enough, the office was in the basement.
And in the other room was Igor. Now, it is not like he was completely at programming. But let's just say he is type of gopnik to use spaces instead of tab. Debil...
You see, when Igor say it's small problem, is usually not a small problem, is a big problem.
His idea of small problem is running out of vodka during the summer team building exercise. You crazy debil.
Igor is... well Igor is crazy. As he was making a significant effort to find a chair for me, from what seemed to be a wall of boxes and old user manuals. I was standing there thinking "Blyat they are not paying me enough for this baby sitting business."
